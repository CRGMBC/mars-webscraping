Challenge 11

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Automated browsing with Splinter was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted with Beautiful Soup
The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted.  
Titles and preview information was extracted using find. function on classes of 'content_title' and 'article_teaser_body'.
This data was joined in a new dictionary called article_dict and appended into articles_list.
